I am a Graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at The Ohio State University; I am working with Dr. Ayonga Hereid. My research has yet to begin, but I plan on focusing on control systems, sensing/perception, and 3D modeling for applications in humanoid robots and exoskeleton devices. My background is in control systems, simulation software, and 3D modeling. I earned a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering from The Ohio State University, and I am very excited to continue my Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering at The Ohio State University as well.
