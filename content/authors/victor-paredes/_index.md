I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at The Ohio State University, working with Dr. Ayonga Hereid. My research endeavors are centered upon advancing the realm of bipedal locomotion, with a specific focus on applications for humanoids and exoskeleton devices. I'm utilizing optimization, template-based planners, and non-linear control as the foundation of my research. Our work heavily relies on the implementation of algorithms, for which I use C++, Python, and MATLAB to manage sensor data and compute real-time control algorithms for our robotic systems. I earned a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University. During this formative period, my academic research gravitated towards the realm of bipedal locomotion and the pioneering field of lower-limb prosthetic devices.
