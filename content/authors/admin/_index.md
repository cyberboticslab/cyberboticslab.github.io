<!-- I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.osu.edu/) at the [Ohio State University](https://osu.edu/) and and the Principal Investigator of the [Cyberbotics Lab](#). Before joining the Ohio State University in 2019, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) with [Prof. Jessy Grizzle](https://ece.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/) to develop safety-critical controllers for powered lower-limb exoskeletons that help individuals with paraplegia to walk again without the use of crutches.

My research aims to develop computational and theoretical tools to mitigate the high dimensionality and nonlinearity present in robot control and motion planning problems. In particular, I strive to pursue these objectives in the challenging domain of humanoid robots and lower-limb exoskeletons. From a broader perspective, the study of bipedal locomotion presents a unique opportunity for multiple disciplines to merge and make fundamental scientific contributions realizable on novel robotic platforms. The *transformative nature of my research* stems from its ability to generate theoretical and computational tools for a variety of robotic, cyber-physical, and autonomous systems that exhibit complex dynamical behaviors.
