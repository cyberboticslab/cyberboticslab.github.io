abstract: 
  'In this paper, we proposed a MLVDS based multimaster real time instrument bus to simultaneously satisfy the requirement of high speed data transmission and low latency. A variety of approaches, such as characteristic impedance matching, termination matching, backplane layout design and isolation of MLVDS differential signals, are taken to optimize its signal integrity. Both the simulation and experiment results manifest that, the transmit rate of the proposed bus can reach 900Mbps (up to 1800Mbps).'
