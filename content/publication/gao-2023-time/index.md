abstract: Controller design for bipedal walking on dynamic rigid surfaces (DRSes), which are rigid surfaces moving in the inertial frame (e.g., ships and airplanes), remains largely underexplored. This paper introduces a hierarchical control approach that achieves stable underactuated bipedal walking on a horizontally oscillating DRS. The highest layer of our approach is a real-time motion planner that generates desired global behaviors (i.e., center of mass trajectories and footstep locations) by stabilizing a reduced-order robot model. One key novelty of this layer is the derivation of the reduced-order model by analytically extending the angular momentum based linear inverted pendulum (ALIP) model from stationary to horizontally moving surfaces. The other novelty is the development of a discrete-time foot-placement controller that exponentially stabilizes the hybrid, linear, time-varying ALIP. The middle layer translates the desired global behaviors into the robotâ€™s full-body reference trajectories for all directly actuated degrees of freedom, while the lowest layer exponentially tracks those reference trajectories based on the full-order, hybrid, nonlinear robot model. Simulations confirm that the proposed framework ensures stable walking of a planar underactuated biped under different swaying DRS motions and gait types.
