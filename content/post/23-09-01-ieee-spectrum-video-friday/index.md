Our recent video of legged robot locomotion testing with the linear impactor has been featured on [IEEE Spectrum Video Friday](https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-squishable-bugbot#toggle-gdpr). This is a preview of our collaborative work between Cyberbotics Lab, Transporation Research Center Inc. and Injury Biomechanics Research Lab (IBRL) at The Ohio State University.
