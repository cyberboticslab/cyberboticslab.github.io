Our group has been awarded the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant from the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov/). The grant will support our research in advancing the motion control technology of humanoid robots and lower-limb exoskeletons. By combining physical insights into bipedal locomotion with advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to improve the motion control technology of bipedal walking robots, thereby benefiting various industries and applications.
