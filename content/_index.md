      #   My research interests lie at the intersection of nonlinear control and optimization theory, with a particular focus on developing novel control solutions for complex robotic systems. The central objective of my research is to develop computationally tractable optimization-based control methodologies that unify formal control theory with advanced numerical optimization techniques and, ultimately, to realize versatile and dynamic maneuvers experimentally on a variety of robotic platforms including home assistant robots and robotic exoskeletons.
